# Dell Pro Max GB10

Various A.I. projects for the Dell Pro Max GB10

I was lent a Dell Pro Max DG10 development system awhile back. I had it for about a week and it was a facinating piece of equipment. Unfortunately I did have to give it back, but the experience of having a machine like that strictly to develope AI applications was kind of fun. Also unfortunately, those things cost $4,000 which is outside of my budget. Fortunately, I do have access to one, at least indirectly.

I developed these apps based on my experience with both the GB10 and the Jetson Orin Nano that I do own. The idea here is to be able to build self contained A.I. applications that can be deployed easiliy and used for the basis of other more advanced projects.

All of these applications should be accessble at port 8080, so you can point a web browser at the GB10 as such, http://192.168.0.200:8080 and the web interface will come up. If you are deploying more than one at a time, you will need to change the ports.
